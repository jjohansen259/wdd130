<p style="width: 75%;">My name is Jordan, this is my second semester here at BYUI, I returned home from my mission a solid week before the Winter Semester started and I jumped right into that. I grew up in Huntsville Utah, and now live in North Ogden Utah. I have one sister whom I am very close with, who is also up here at BYUI. I am a big fan of anything competitive. if it allows me to see strategy and ways to improve, and improving makes me win, I'm there for it. This includes sports, personal favorite is Basketball, card and board and video games all give me that same drive to win!

    I am also a big fan of stories. Hilariously, reading is a necessary evil, but I love books. I have a big bookshelf with several of my favorite books, and a long series called the Wheel of Time where I got special after market covers where it creates a 15 book long banner on the shelf.</p>
